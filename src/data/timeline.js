            'During my time at the University of Indianapolis, I gained a strong foundation in software development, working on real-world projects that honed my skills in full-stack development, cloud computing, and machine learning. I collaborated in teams using Agile methodologies, ensuring our projects met engineering standards through iterative development, code reviews, and efficient problem-solving. Courses in algorithms, network security, and NLP deepened my technical expertise, while hands-on experience with Django, Firebase, and Docker strengthened my ability to build scalable applications. My time at UIndy shaped me into an adaptable and detail-oriented software engineer, ready to tackle complex challenges.'
