        title: 'Chemistry Inventory Application',
        duration: '1 year',
        details: "I worked on this development project with my CSCI 498 teammates throughout the 2024-2025 school year. Our goal was to create an inventory application for the chemistry department at UIndy that helped them keep track of the chemicals they had in stock. To enable better tracking and management of their inventory, we built this web application using Django, a Python web framework that was really fun to use, alongside MySQL, Docker, and the standard web technologies of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We also implemented HTMX, Tailwind, and several specialized Django libraries that were tremendously helpful. This project gave me valuable hands-on experience that closely resembled real-world development scenarios. I implemented significant portions of the UI and worked extensively with the provided database. If you'd like to hear more about the project, please feel free to reach out."

        title: 'First Web Development Class',
        duration: '6 months',
        details: "My GUI and Game Development course initially focused on creating games through Unity using C#. However, as the class progressed, we transitioned to learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which is where I wrote my first lines of web development code. This shift in focus proved transformative for me. While game development was interesting, I found myself more drawn to building web browser websites. After creating my first HTML page, I was immediately captivated by the process. Though my initial project was a basic portfolio site with introductory functionality, this experience allowed me to discover my true passion for web application development. The immediate visual feedback and accessibility of web technologies resonated with me in ways that game development hadn't, cementing my desire to pursue web application development as my primary career focus."
